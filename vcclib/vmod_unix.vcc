$Module unix 3 "Unix Socket Utilities (unix)"

$ABI strict

DESCRIPTION
===========

The ``unix`` vmod provides information about the credentials of the peer
process (user and group of the process owner) that is connected to a
Varnish listener via a Unix domain socket, if the platform supports
it.

Errors
------

All functions in this VMOD are subject to the following constraints:

* None of them may be called in ``sub vcl_init`` or ``sub vcl_fini``. If one
  of them is called in ``sub vcl_init``, then the VCL program will fail to
  load, with an error message from the VMOD.

* If called on a platform that is not supported, then VCL failure is
  invoked. An error message is written to the log (with the
  ``sub vcl_Error`` tag), and for all VCL subroutines except for
  ``sub vcl_synth``, control is directed immediately to ``sub vcl_synth``,
  with the response status set to 503 and the reason string set to
  "VCL failed".

  If the failure occurs during ``sub vcl_synth``, then ``sub vcl_synth`` is
  aborted, and the the response line "503 VCL failed" is sent.

* If the current listener is not a Unix domain socket, or if the
  attempt to read credentials fails, then a ``sub vcl_Error`` message is
  written to the log. The STRING functions (``vmod_user`` and
  ``vmod_group``) return NULL, while the INT functions (``vmod_uid``
  and ``vmod_gid``) return -1.

EXAMPLES
========

::

  import unix;

  sub vcl_recv {
    # Return "403 Forbidden" if the connected peer is
    # not running as the user "trusteduser".
    if (unix.user() != "trusteduser") {
      return( synth(403) );
    }

    # Require the connected peer to run in the group
    # "trustedgroup".
    if (unix.group() != "trustedgroup") {
      return( synth(403) );
    }

    # Require the connected peer to run under a specific numeric
    # user id.
    if (unix.uid() != 4711) {
      return( synth(403) );
    }

    # Require the connected peer to run under a numeric group id.
    if (unix.gid() != 815) {
      return( synth(403) );
    }
  }

Obtaining the peer credentials is possible on a platform that supports
one of the following:

* ``getpeereid(3)`` (such as FreeBSD and other BSD-derived systems)

* the socket option ``SO_PEERCRED`` for ``getsockopt(2)`` (Linux)

* ``getpeerucred(3C)`` (SunOS and descendants)

On SunOS and friends, the ``PRIV_PROC_INFO`` privilege set is added to
the Varnish child process while the VMOD is loaded, see
``setppriv(2)``.

On most platforms, the value returned is the effective user or group
that was valid when the peer process initiated the connection.

$Function STRING user()
$Restrict client backend

Return the user name of the peer process owner.

$Function STRING group()
$Restrict client backend

Return the group name of the peer process owner.

$Function INT uid()
$Restrict client backend

Return the numeric user id of the peer process owner.

$Function INT gid()
$Restrict client backend

Return the numeric group id of the peer process owner.

AVAILABILITY
============

The ``unix`` VMOD is available in Varnish Enterprise version ``6.0.0r0`` and later.
