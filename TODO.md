# VCL Parser TODO and Future Enhancements

This document outlines planned improvements and extensions for the VCL parser implementation.

## Current Limitations

### Object Literal Parsing
- Issue: Complex backend properties like inline probes are not fully supported
- Example: `.probe = { .url = "/health"; .interval = 5s; }`
- Impact: Parser fails on backends with nested object properties
- Priority: High

### VMOD Support
- Issue: VMOD function calls and imports are parsed but not validated
- Example: `import directors; new cluster = directors.round_robin();`
- Impact: No type checking for VMOD functions and their parameters
- Priority: Medium

### Advanced Expression Parsing
- Issue: Some complex expressions may not parse correctly
- Example: Ternary operators, complex string interpolation
- Impact: Limited support for advanced VCL constructs
- Priority: Medium

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Object Literal Support
- [ ] Nested Object Parsing: Support for complex backend/probe definitions
- [ ] Property Validation: Ensure only valid properties are used in each context
- [ ] Default Values: Handle optional properties with sensible defaults
- [ ] Type Checking: Validate property types (string, duration, integer, etc.)

Example:
```vcl
backend web {
    .host = "example.com";
    .probe = {
        .url = "/health";
        .interval = 30s;
        .timeout = 5s;
        .window = 5;
        .threshold = 3;
        .initial = 2;
    };
}
```

### 2. VMOD Integration and Validation
- [ ] VMOD Registry: Built-in knowledge of standard VMODs
- [ ] Function Signature Validation: Type-check VMOD function calls
- [ ] Import Resolution: Validate imported VMOD availability
- [ ] Custom VMOD Support: Parse `.vcc` files for custom VMODs
- [ ] Documentation Generation: Extract VMOD documentation from parsed files

Supported VMODs:
- `std` - Standard library functions
- `directors` - Load balancing directors
- `cookie` - Cookie manipulation
- `header` - Header manipulation
- `purge` - Advanced purging capabilities
- `vsthrottle` - Request throttling

### 3. Advanced Semantic Analysis
- [ ] Variable Scope Analysis: Track variable accessibility across VCL methods
- [ ] Method Flow Validation: Ensure proper VCL method call sequences
- [ ] Return Value Checking: Validate return statements match method requirements
- [ ] Dead Code Detection: Identify unreachable code after return statements
- [ ] Variable Usage Analysis: Detect unused variables and invalid access patterns

### 4. Code Generation and Transformation
- [ ] VCL Formatter: Pretty-print VCL with consistent style
- [ ] VCL Minifier: Remove comments and unnecessary whitespace
- [ ] Version Migration: Upgrade VCL from 4.0 to 4.1 automatically
- [ ] Configuration Optimization: Suggest performance improvements
- [ ] Documentation Generator: Create HTML/Markdown docs from VCL

### 5. Advanced Error Recovery
- [ ] Partial Parsing: Continue parsing after encountering errors
- [ ] Error Suggestions: Provide fix suggestions for common mistakes
- [ ] Multiple Error Reporting: Report all errors in a single pass
- [ ] Syntax Highlighting: Support for IDE integration with error markers

### 6. Language Server Protocol (LSP) Support
- [ ] Autocomplete: Variable and function name completion
- [ ] Hover Information: Show variable types and function signatures
- [ ] Go to Definition: Jump to variable/function definitions
- [ ] Diagnostics: Real-time error and warning reporting
- [ ] Refactoring: Rename variables across files

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Fuzzing: Automated testing with malformed VCL inputs
- [ ] Performance Benchmarks: Measure parsing speed with large VCL files
- [ ] Memory Profiling: Optimize memory usage for large ASTs
- [ ] Compliance Testing: Test against official VCL test suite
- [ ] Edge Case Coverage: Handle unusual but valid VCL constructs

### 8. Integration and Tooling
- [ ] CLI Tools: Command-line utilities for VCL validation and formatting
- [ ] GitHub Actions: CI/CD integration for VCL validation
- [ ] VS Code Extension: Syntax highlighting and error checking
- [ ] Web Interface: Online VCL validator and formatter
- [ ] API Server: RESTful API for VCL parsing and validation

### 9. Advanced VCL Features
- [ ] ESI Support: Parse and validate Edge Side Includes
- [ ] Regular Expression Validation: Check regex syntax in VCL
- [ ] Time/Duration Arithmetic: Validate time calculations
- [ ] IP Address Validation: Ensure valid IP addresses and CIDR ranges
- [ ] String Template Support: Advanced string interpolation

### 10. Documentation and Learning
- [ ] Interactive Tutorial: Web-based VCL learning tool
- [ ] Best Practices Guide: Automated VCL code review suggestions
- [ ] Migration Guide: Help transitioning from other cache solutions
- [ ] Performance Guide: VCL optimization recommendations
- [ ] Security Guide: Security best practices validation

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Improvements (Next 2-3 months)
1. Object literal parsing for backend properties
2. Basic VMOD function validation
3. Enhanced error messages and recovery
4. VCL formatter implementation

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis (Next 6 months)
1. Complete semantic analysis
2. LSP server implementation
3. VMOD registry and validation
4. Code generation tools

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration (Next year)
1. IDE extensions and plugins
2. CI/CD integrations
3. Web-based tools
4. Advanced optimization features

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Priority should be given to:
1. Object literal parsing - Most critical missing feature
2. Test coverage expansion - More edge cases and real-world VCL files
3. Documentation - Usage examples and API documentation
4. Performance optimization - Faster parsing for large files

## Performance Goals

- Parse 1MB VCL files in under 100ms
- Memory usage under 10MB for typical VCL configurations
- Support for files with 10,000+ lines
- Incremental parsing for LSP responsiveness

## Compatibility

The parser should maintain compatibility with:
- VCL 4.0 and VCL 4.1 syntax
- Varnish Cache 6.x and 7.x built-in variables
- Standard VMODs shipped with Varnish
- Enterprise VMODs from Varnish Software

This roadmap ensures the VCL parser evolves into a comprehensive toolchain for VCL development, analysis, and optimization.
